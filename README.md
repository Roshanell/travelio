# Travelio


This project allowed me to practice more with components, states, useEffect, and props with React.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js

I was able to implement prop and components in order to create this project.

## Optimizations

I plan to optimize this project by allowing users to enter thier own data to create entries into travelio. I would like add an option to connect the data to Mongo and use express and node to create a server side application with CRUD abilities.

This app can be optimized for all screen sizes as well.
## Lessons Learned:

React JS really fun to practice with. I like being able to render multiple components and reuse them without having to hard code every thing. I love how intuitive React is. 

I built this project so that I can primarily focus on props and components.
